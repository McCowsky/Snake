# Reflections:

The goal of this project was to make another game using javascript canvas so i could increase my skill in both javascript and typescript. This time i opted for one of the most famous and simple game - Snake. 						

The project allowed me to learn much about classes in javascript. Classes was also the main challange in this project. This lead me to spend a few days on a research and learning how to implement them in my game.
